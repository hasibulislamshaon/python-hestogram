The Macintosh Classic is a personal computer sold by Apple Computer from October 15, 1990, to September 14, 1992. The Classic was similar to its predecessors: due to limited technological advances, it had the same 9-inch (23 cm) monochrome CRT display, 512 Ã— 342 pixel resolution, and 4 megabyte (MB) memory limit of older Macintosh computers. Nevertheless, the Classic featured several improvements over the Macintosh Plus, which it replaced as Apple's low-end Mac computer. It was up to 25 percent faster than the Plus and included an Apple SuperDrive 3.5-inch (9 cm) floppy disk drive as standard. Apple released two versions that ranged in price from US$1,000 to $1,500. Reviewers' reactions were mixed; most focused on the slow processor performance and lack of expansion slots. They also noted that the Classic was powerful enough for word processing, spreadsheets, and databases. The price and availability of education software led to the computer's popularity in education.
